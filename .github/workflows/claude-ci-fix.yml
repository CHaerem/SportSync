            The "Update Sports Data" workflow just failed.
            Read CLAUDE.md for project context and automation rules.

            Your task:
            1. Fetch the failed workflow run logs using `gh run view ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }} --log-failed`.
            2. Analyze the failure — identify the root cause.
            3. If the fix is bounded and low-risk (see CLAUDE.md automation rules):
               - Create a branch with prefix `claude/fix-`,
               - Apply the fix,
               - Run `npm test` to verify,
               - Push and open a PR explaining the failure and fix.
            4. If the fix is complex or high-risk:
               - Create a GitHub issue with label `ci-failure` describing the
                 failure, root cause analysis, and suggested fix.

            Safety constraints:
            - Never modify protected paths listed in CLAUDE.md.
            - Always run `npm test` before committing. Revert if tests fail.
            - Keep changes under 8 files and 300 lines.
