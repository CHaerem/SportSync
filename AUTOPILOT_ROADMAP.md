# Autopilot Roadmap

Prioritized task queue for the Claude autopilot workflow. The autopilot picks the first `[PENDING]` task, executes it, and opens a PR. Reorder tasks to change priority. One task per run, one open PR at a time.

## Task Format

- `[PENDING]` — Ready to be picked up
- `[DONE]` (PR #N) — Completed
- `[BLOCKED]` reason — Cannot proceed until unblocked

---

## Scouting Heuristics

When scouting for improvement opportunities, apply these detection patterns in addition to the standard checks (dead code, TODO comments, missing tests):

### A. Dead Field Detection

Scan `scripts/build-events.js` event schema for fields that are always empty or default in `docs/data/events.json`. For each dead field, check if the data source (fetcher in `scripts/fetch/`) already has the data to populate it.

**How to check:** Load `events.json`, iterate events, find fields that are always `[]`, `null`, `""`, or `0` across all entries. Cross-reference with the fetcher output to see if the data exists upstream but isn't being mapped.

**Example:** `featuredGroups` is always `[]` on golf events, but `scripts/fetch/golf.js` already scrapes PGA Tour tee times for all field players — grouping by tee time + starting hole gives us pairings for free.

### B. Data-to-UI Gap Detection

Compare fields loaded in `docs/js/dashboard.js` vs what's actually rendered. Fields that are loaded or destructured but never appear in any `render*()` method are dead UI paths.

**How to check:** Search for field names in dashboard.js data loading (e.g., `featured.json` parse, `events.json` parse) and verify each field has a corresponding render path that produces visible DOM output.

**Example:** `featuredGroups` is loaded but no render code references it — the data flows through the pipeline but is invisible to users.

### C. Fetcher Data Waste Detection

Check if API fetchers extract data that's discarded or only partially used. Fetchers may parse rich API responses but only store a subset of the available fields.

**How to check:** Read each fetcher's API response handling and compare the fields extracted vs the fields written to the output JSON. Flag cases where useful data (names, times, scores, stats) is available but dropped.

**Example:** PGA Tour scraper gets tee times for 150+ players but only stores Norwegian players' times on events — groupmate names are available in the same API response but discarded.

## EXPERIENCE Lane (User Impact)

Keep this section near the top so the autopilot continuously improves user-facing outcomes, not just code hygiene.

### Active KPIs

- `watch_plan_engagement` — % of sessions that expand at least one suggested watch item
- `enrichment_coverage` — % of events with importance, summary, tags, and Norwegian relevance
- `featured_quality_score` — quality gate score from `docs/data/ai-quality.json`

### Current Tasks

- [DONE] (PR #49) Populate golf `featuredGroups` in fetcher — Added `buildFeaturedGroups()` to `scripts/fetch/golf.js` that groups PGA Tour field players by teeTime + startingHole and stores groupmates for each Norwegian player.

- [DONE] (PR #50) Render golf `featuredGroups` in dashboard — Added "Playing with: X, Y" display under each Norwegian player's tee time in expanded golf event view. CSS class `.exp-playing-with` added to `index.html`.

- [BLOCKED] reverted — user prefers manual user-context.json | Add watch-plan feedback loop — PR #47 was reverted. Thumbs-up/down controls are not wanted at this time.

- [BLOCKED] reverted — depends on feedback UI | Track recommendation conversion signals — Add lightweight client-side telemetry counters for `watch-plan` item clicks and streaming-link opens.

- [DONE] (already implemented server-side) Personalize watch-plan ranking with favorites export — `scoreEventForWatchPlan()` in `scripts/lib/watch-plan.js` already boosts +18 for favorite teams/players and +12 for favorite esports orgs. `exportForBackend()` outputs in the exact format consumed by `userContext`.

---

## HIGH Priority

- [DONE] (PR #4) Fix service worker stale file references — `docs/sw.js` lines 25,27 cache `personalized-dashboard.js` and `event-filter.js` which do not exist. Remove these entries from the cache list to prevent SW installation failures.

- [DONE] (PR #5) Implement `updateFilterCount()` stub in `docs/js/simple-dashboard.js` — Called on lines 60 and 80 but the method body (lines 95-98) is empty. Add a visible count indicator showing how many events match the active filter.

- [DONE] (manual session) Remove legacy fetch scripts — Deleted 5 legacy fetchers, `migration-helper.js`, and `test-refactored.js`. Renamed `-refactored` versions to clean names via `git mv`. Simplified `scripts/fetch/index.js` to call fetchers directly. ~1,000 lines removed.

## MEDIUM Priority

- [DONE] (PR #6) Add dashboard filter tests — Extract pure functions into `docs/js/dashboard-helpers.js` and add 52 unit tests for filter logic, time formatting, sport display, HTML escaping, team abbreviation, favorites detection, and combined filtering.

- [DONE] (PR #7) Add data freshness warning UI — When `docs/data/meta.json` shows data older than 24 hours, display a subtle banner on the dashboard informing users that data may be stale. Currently only checked in the maintenance workflow.

- [DONE] (PR #8) Remove failed open-data fallback attempts — `docs/js/sports-api.js` tries to fetch `-open.json` variants (lines 18, 145, 180, 220) that don't exist, causing unnecessary 404s. Remove these dead fallback paths.

- [DONE] (PR #9) Add accessibility improvements — Dashboard lacks ARIA attributes: add `role="navigation"` to filter section, `aria-pressed` to filter buttons, `aria-label` to icon-only buttons (theme toggle, settings), `role="list"`/`role="listitem"` to event cards, and `aria-live="polite"` to the events container.

- [DONE] (PR #10) Add image lazy loading — Event card images (team logos, tournament badges) loaded by `simple-dashboard.js` should use `loading="lazy"` attribute for better performance on slow connections.

## LOW Priority

- [DONE] (PR #11) Clean up console.log statements — Removed 32 debug-level console.log calls across `docs/sw.js`, `docs/js/sports-api.js`, `docs/js/simple-dashboard.js`, and `docs/index.html`. Retained console.error calls for genuine errors.

- [DONE] (PR #12) Add CSS class for `event-time-exact` — Added missing CSS definition for the `event-time-exact` class: smaller font, muted color, reduced opacity, tabular-nums for digit alignment.

- [DONE] (PR #13) Add keyboard navigation for sport filters — Added `:focus-visible` outline styles to `.filter-btn` and `.sport-filter` elements. Buttons are native `<button>` elements so Enter/Space already works natively.

- [DONE] (clarified) Clarify `scripts/fetch/fotball-no.js` — Already integrated: imported by both `football.js` and `football-refactored.js` to fetch OBOS-ligaen Lyn matches. No changes needed.

- [DONE] (already resolved) Add `ai-assistant.js` to service worker cache list — File was already present in SW cache at `docs/sw.js` line 25. No changes needed.

## Scouted Tasks (2026-02-10)

### HIGH Priority

- [DONE] (PR #15) Remove dead code in `docs/js/sports-api.js` — Removed unreachable TheSportsDB fallback block, four unused format methods, and unused apiKeys property. 93 lines removed.

- [DONE] (PR #16) Fix memory leak in `docs/js/simple-dashboard.js` — Stored setInterval return value in `this.refreshInterval` for proper cleanup.

- [DONE] (PR #17) Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to streaming links — Added missing security attribute to streaming badge links in simple-dashboard.js.

### MEDIUM Priority

- [DONE] (PR #18) Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support — Added media query to disable all transitions and animations for users with motion sensitivity preferences.

- [DONE] (PR #19) Remove unused CSS rules — Removed `.view-toggle` and `.view-btn` styles (~39 lines) that had no corresponding HTML elements. Kept `@keyframes spin` which is actively used by the loading spinner.

- [DONE] (PR #20) Add `dashboard-helpers.js` to service worker cache — Added to SW install cache list and bumped cache version to v11-helpers.

- [DONE] (PR #21) Add unit tests for `preferences-manager.js` — Added 29 tests covering load/save, sport/team/player CRUD, fuzzy matching, multi-criteria event favorite detection, view/theme preferences, exportForBackend, and reset.

- [DONE] (PR #22) Add unit tests for `sports-api.js` formatters — Added 17 tests covering formatTournamentData, formatDateTime, and groupEventsByDay.

### LOW Priority

- [DONE] (PR #23) Add meta description and theme-color tags — Added SEO description and #667eea theme-color for mobile browsers.

- [DONE] (PR #24) Fix duplicate emoji mappings — Extracted sport emoji/name mapping into shared `docs/js/sport-config.js` constant, replacing duplicates in `simple-dashboard.js`, `settings-ui.js`, and `dashboard-helpers.js`.

- [DONE] (PR #25) Add input validation to preferences-manager — Added null/empty/whitespace guards to `addFavoriteTeam()` and `addFavoritePlayer()`, plus return values and 6 tests.

## Intelligent Content System

The dashboard uses a **featured content system** that works in two layers:

1. **`scripts/generate-featured.js`** — runs during each build, calls Claude API to generate `docs/data/featured.json`
2. **`scripts/config/*.json`** — curated event configs that the autopilot creates autonomously

### How It Works

```
Autopilot detects major event → creates scripts/config/{event}.json
                                        ↓
Build pipeline auto-discovers config → merges events into events.json
                                        ↓
generate-featured.js reads events.json + curated configs → calls Claude API
                                        ↓
Claude generates featured.json (brief, sections, radar)
                                        ↓
Dashboard renders featured.json flexibly — no frontend changes needed
```

**`featured.json` schema:**
- **brief**: 2-3 editorial lines summarizing the day
- **sections**: dynamic featured content blocks (types: "stat", "event", "text")
- **radar**: 2-3 "on the radar" sentences about upcoming events

### Autonomous Autopilot Directive

The autopilot should **proactively and autonomously** monitor the sports calendar and create content when major events approach or begin. **No human intervention required.** The autopilot:

1. **Detects** major events by analyzing `docs/data/events.json` for tournament names, context tags, and upcoming schedules
2. **Creates** curated config files in `scripts/config/` with event schedules, Norwegian athletes, and streaming info
3. **The pipeline handles the rest** — `build-events.js` auto-discovers configs, `generate-featured.js` feeds them to the LLM

#### Curated Config Format (`scripts/config/*.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "Event Name",
  "location": "City, Country",
  "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "context": "event-id",
  "norwegianAthletes": ["Athlete Name", ...],
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Event Title",
      "time": "ISO 8601 datetime",
      "venue": "Venue Name",
      "norwegian": true,
      "norwegianPlayers": [{"name": "Athlete Name"}],
      "streaming": [{"platform": "NRK", "type": "tv"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### When to Create Curated Configs

- **Olympics** (Winter or Summer): Norwegian athlete schedules, medal events, daily highlights
- **FIFA World Cup**: Group matches with Norway interest, knockout stages, match schedules
- **Champions League knockout stages**: Bracket fixtures, Norwegian club/player involvement
- **Grand Slams** (tennis): Draw brackets, Ruud/Norwegian player matchups
- **Major golf tournaments**: Hovland tee times, leaderboard tracking, cut-line info
- **Any new major event** the autopilot detects approaching in the event data

#### Rules for Autonomous Content

- One curated config per major event (e.g., `olympics-2026.json`, `world-cup-2026.json`)
- Config file name should be descriptive: `{event}-{year}.json`
- Always focus on Norwegian athletes and Norwegian interest
- Include streaming info (NRK, Eurosport, TV2, etc.) when known
- Delete or archive configs after events end (move to `scripts/config/archive/`)
- The `context` field must match between config and generated events for proper grouping

### Coverage Gap Detection

The pipeline generates `docs/data/coverage-gaps.json` every 2 hours via `scripts/detect-coverage-gaps.js`.
During nightly runs, the autopilot should:

1. Read `docs/data/coverage-gaps.json`
2. For each gap with `classification: "actionable"` and `confidence: "high"`:
   - If the suggested config does not exist in `scripts/config/`, create it
   - Research the event schedule using available data and web search
   - Follow the curated config format (see above)
3. For `confidence: "medium"` actionable gaps:
   - Create a GitHub issue suggesting the coverage gap for human review
4. For `confidence: "low"` or `classification: "informational"`:
   - Skip (transient news, not worth acting on)
5. Log all gap processing in `docs/data/autopilot-log.json`

### Pipeline Health Monitoring

The pipeline generates `docs/data/health-report.json` every 2 hours via `scripts/pipeline-health.js`.
During nightly runs, the autopilot should:

1. Read `docs/data/health-report.json`
2. If `status: "critical"`, prioritize repair tasks over roadmap tasks
3. Common repair actions:
   - `sport_dropped` → investigate the fetcher for that sport, check API changes
   - `stale_data` → check if the API endpoint has moved or requires new auth
   - `rss_low` → verify RSS feed URLs are still valid
4. If `status: "warning"`, note issues but continue with roadmap tasks

### Pending Content Tasks

- [DONE] (obsolete — file deleted in ultra-minimal redesign) Remove unused mock tournament methods from sports-api.js — `docs/js/sports-api.js` was removed from the runtime dashboard path.

- [DONE] (already in workflow) Add workflow step for generate-featured.js — Step exists in `.github/workflows/update-sports-data.yml` and now also generates `watch-plan.json` + `ai-quality.json`.

- [DONE] (already in workflow) Increase data update frequency — Cron is already `0 */2 * * *` in `.github/workflows/update-sports-data.yml`.

## Autonomy Infrastructure (2026-02-12)

Closed-loop self-improvement system. Autonomy score: **100% (8/8 loops closed)**.

### Completed

- [DONE] (manual session) Adaptive prompt hints for featured generation — `buildAdaptiveHints()` in `ai-quality-gates.js` reads last 5 quality snapshots, generates corrective prompts when metrics underperform thresholds. Wired into `generate-featured.js`. 8 tests.

- [DONE] (manual session) Adaptive enrichment hints — `buildEnrichmentHints()` in `enrich-events.js` checks `ai-quality.json` for low tag/summary coverage or failed batches, injects corrections into enrichment prompt. 7 tests.

- [DONE] (manual session) Coverage gap auto-resolver — `scripts/resolve-coverage-gaps.js` reads `coverage-gaps.json` and creates skeleton curated configs for high/medium-confidence actionable gaps. Wired into `detect-coverage-gaps.js` to run automatically. 11 tests.

- [DONE] (manual session) Autonomy scorecard — `scripts/autonomy-scorecard.js` evaluates 8 feedback loops (featured quality, enrichment quality, coverage gaps, pipeline health, watch plan, code health, discovery, schedule verification). Wired into `pipeline-health.js`. Outputs `autonomy-report.json`.

- [DONE] (manual session) Discovery feedback loop (Loop 7) — `discover-events.js` + `sync-configs.js` auto-discover events, athletes, and schedules via Claude CLI + WebSearch. `autonomy-scorecard.js` tracks discovery health.

- [DONE] (manual session) Schedule verification feedback loop (Loop 8) — `scripts/lib/schedule-verifier.js` with 5 pluggable verifiers (static, ESPN, RSS, sport data, web re-check). Per-event confidence scoring. `buildVerificationHints()` injects accuracy corrections into discovery prompts. `verification-history.json` tracks last 50 runs. 68 tests.

- [DONE] (manual session) Centralize time constants — `MS_PER_MINUTE`, `MS_PER_HOUR`, `MS_PER_DAY` in `helpers.js`, replaced magic numbers across codebase.

- [DONE] (manual session) Reorder LLM provider priority — Anthropic checked before OpenAI in `llm-client.js`.

- [DONE] (manual session) Clean dead frontend code — Removed `renderRadar()`, `#radar` div, radar CSS. Trimmed SW cache from 14 to 6 data files.

- [DONE] (manual session) Fix gitignore whitelist — Added `health-report.json`, `coverage-gaps.json`, `quality-history.json`, `autonomy-report.json` to whitelist. Diagnostic data was being silently excluded from commits.

- [BLOCKED] reverted — user prefers manual user-context.json | Add thumbs-up/down feedback to watch-plan items — PR #47 was reverted.

- [BLOCKED] reverted — depends on feedback UI | Surface engagement signals in pipeline — Read `localStorage` feedback data via a small client-side export mechanism. Feed into `watch-plan.js` scoring to boost/demote events matching user feedback patterns. ~80 lines across 2 files.

- [BLOCKED] protected path — requires `.github/workflows/` modification | Wire autonomy score into GitHub Actions summary — Add autonomy score to the workflow step summary output alongside pipeline health.

- [DONE] (PR #48) Add trend tracking to autonomy scorecard — Added `trackTrend()` and `detectRegressions()` to track autonomy score over time in `autonomy-trend.json`. Wired into pipeline-health.js.

- [DONE] (PR #51) Add client-side engagement tracking — Added `trackEngagement()` to `preferences-manager.js` that records per-sport click counts and timestamps in localStorage. Wired into dashboard expand handler.

- [BLOCKED] depends on engagement tracking + data export | Add preference evolution pipeline script — New script to read engagement data and update `user-context.json` sport weights. Requires a mechanism to get client-side localStorage data back to the pipeline.

- [BLOCKED] protected path — requires autopilot workflow/prompt modification | Add opportunity detection to autopilot scouting — After completing roadmap tasks, analyze RSS trends + coverage gaps + engagement signals to identify new features or data sources worth adding.

- [BLOCKED] protected path — all `|| echo "failed"` handlers are in `.github/workflows/update-sports-data.yml` | Replace silent pipeline failures with structured error reporting — Requires workflow file modification which is a protected path.

## Scouted Tasks (2026-02-12, run 2)

### HIGH Priority

- [DONE] (PR #53) Add keyboard accessibility to event rows — Added `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, `aria-expanded` to event row divs and delegated keydown handler for Enter/Space expand toggle.

### MEDIUM Priority

- [PENDING] Render chess/tennis participants in expanded view — `docs/js/dashboard.js` loads `event.participants` (line 93) but never renders it. For chess and tennis events with participants, show "Players: X, Y" in the expanded event view. Only change `docs/js/dashboard.js`. ~10 lines, LOW risk.

- [PENDING] Add unit tests for `scripts/fetch/golf.js` — Test `buildFeaturedGroups()`, `playerNameMatches()`, `tournamentNameMatches()`, `filterNorwegiansAgainstField()`, and `parseTeeTimeToUTC()` with mocked data. New file `tests/golf-fetcher.test.js`. ~80 lines, LOW risk.

### LOW Priority

- [PENDING] Remove unused `meta` field from dashboard event loading — `docs/js/dashboard.js` line 85 loads `ev.meta` but it's never rendered in any DOM output. Remove the field from the event mapping to reduce unnecessary data. Only change `docs/js/dashboard.js`. ~1 line, LOW risk.
